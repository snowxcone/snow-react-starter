# Snow's react starter woot woot
Starter build for React single page app 

NOTES/LEARNINGS:
- Webpack bundles up all the dependencies listed in package.json. It understands JS but needs plugins to understand other languages like HTML, CSS
- Plugins work at the bundle level and differ from Webpack loaders, which work at the file level to transform data (e.g. sass loader compiles SCSS to CSS)
- Babel is a loader that transforms ES6+ JS to ES5 JS for browser compatibility 
- Npm is node's package manager that helps us download these dependencies
